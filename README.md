# PostPlace

## Overview

PostPlace is a web app that will provide basic social media functionalities such as logging in, creating posts, editing your profile, and commenting on posts. Users must register for an account or log in with a visitor account before being able to see posts. 

## Data Model

The application will store Users, Posts, and Comments.

- users can have multiple posts (via references)
- posts can have multiple comments (via references)

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  name: "Ricky Zhang",
  username: "rz2342",
  password: // a password hash,
  posts: // an array of Post ids
}
```

An Example Post:

```javascript
{
  content: "content of the post",
  user: // the _id of the user who created the post,
  timestamp: // the timestamp of when the post was created,
  comments: // an array of Comment ids
}
```

An example Comment:

```javascript
{
  content: "content of the comment",
  user: // the _id of the user who created the comment,
  timestamp: // the timestamp of when the comment was created,
  post: // the id of the post
}


## [Link to Commented First Draft Schema](db.mjs) 

(__TODO__: create a first draft of your Schemas in db.mjs and link to it)

## Wireframes

(__TODO__: wireframes for all of the pages on your site; they can be as simple as photos of drawings or you can use a tool like Balsamiq, Omnigraffle, etc.)

/list/create - page for creating a new shopping list

![list create](documentation/list-create.png)

/list - page for showing all shopping lists

![list](documentation/list.png)

/list/slug - page for showing specific shopping list

![list](documentation/list-slug.png)

## Site map

(__TODO__: draw out a site map that shows how pages are related to each other)

Here's a [complex example from wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Sitemap_google.jpg), but you can create one without the screenshots, drop shadows, etc. ... just names of pages and where they flow to.

## User Stories or Use Cases

(__TODO__: write out how your application will be used through [user stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Format) and / or [use cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case))

1. as non-registered user, I can register a new account with the site
2. as a user, I can log in to the site
3. as a user, I can create a new grocery list
4. as a user, I can view all of the grocery lists I've created in a single list
5. as a user, I can add items to an existing grocery list
6. as a user, I can cross off items in an existing grocery list

## Research Topics

(__TODO__: the research topics that you're planning on working on along with their point values... and the total points of research topics listed)

* (5 points) Integrate user authentication
    * I'm going to be using passport for user authentication
    * And account has been made for testing; I'll email you the password
    * see <code>cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/ait-final/register</code> for register page
    * see <code>cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/ait-final/login</code> for login page
* (4 points) Perform client side form validation using a JavaScript library
    * see <code>cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/ait-final/my-form</code>
    * if you put in a number that's greater than 5, an error message will appear in the dom
* (5 points) vue.js
    * used vue.js as the frontend framework; it's a challenging library to learn, so I've assigned it 5 points

10 points total out of 8 required points (___TODO__: addtional points will __not__ count for extra credit)


## [Link to Initial Main Project File](app.mjs) 

(__TODO__: create a skeleton Express application with a package.json, app.mjs, views folder, etc. ... and link to your initial app.mjs)

## Annotations / References Used

(__TODO__: list any tutorials/references/etc. that you've based your code off of)

1. [passport.js authentication docs](http://passportjs.org/docs) - (add link to source code that was based on this)
2. [tutorial on vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) - (add link to source code that was based on this)
